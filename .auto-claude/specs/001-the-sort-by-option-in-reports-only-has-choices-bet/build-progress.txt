Project: Add ASC/DESC Sort Direction for Reports
Spec ID: 001
Workspace: /Users/bobrietveld/Documents/Techleap/sodt_app
Started: 2024-12-24

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a feature enhancement that extends existing sorting functionality with ASC/DESC direction controls. Changes span frontend UI components, state management, and backend query logic, following established patterns in the codebase.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Completed Phase 0: Deep codebase investigation
- Created implementation_plan.json with 5 phases and 5 subtasks
- Created init.sh setup script
- Updated context.json with codebase patterns
- Created build-progress.txt

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Backend API Enhancement): 1 subtask, depends on []
  - Add sortBy/sortDirection to browseReportsPaginated query

- Phase 2 (Sort Selector UI Enhancement): 1 subtask, depends on []
  - Add SortDirection type and toggle UI component

- Phase 3 (State Management & API Integration): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-1, phase-2]
  - Wire sortDirection state, update API calls, client-side sorting

- Phase 4 (Table Header Enhancement): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-3]
  - Update SortableHeader with direction toggle and indicators

- Phase 5 (Integration & Verification): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-4]
  - End-to-end verification of all sorting functionality

Services Involved:
- main: Next.js frontend with React components and Convex backend

Files to Modify:
- convex/pdfs.ts (backend query with sortBy/sortDirection args)
- src/components/reports/sort-selector.tsx (add direction toggle UI)
- src/app/reports/reports-content.tsx (state management, API calls)
- src/components/reports/report-table.tsx (header click behavior, arrow icons)

Reference Files:
- src/components/reports/view-toggle.tsx (toggle UI pattern)
- src/components/reports/filter-panel.tsx (styling patterns)

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2 (phase-1 and phase-2 can run concurrently)
- Recommended workers: 1 (small feature, sequential is simpler)
- Parallel groups: [phase-1-backend, phase-2-sort-selector]

Risk Assessment:
- Risk level: low
- No security concerns
- No database schema changes
- Backward compatible (defaults to DESC)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 001 --parallel 1

Or manually start development:

  cd /Users/bobrietveld/Documents/Techleap/sodt_app
  npm run dev

Then visit http://localhost:3000/reports to test.
